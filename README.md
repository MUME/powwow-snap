## Command-line Installation

    sudo snap install powwow

([Don't have snapd installed?](https://snapcraft.io/docs/core/install))

That'll install the latest _stable_ release of `powwow`.

If you want the _next point release_ of `htop`, install from the `beta` channel instead:

    sudo snap install powwow --beta

Or, if you're feeling adventurous, try the _next major release_ from the `edge` channel:

    sudo snap install powwow --edge
